## Write a scraper!

Could you write a simple python scraper that will:

* Fetch 100 example releases or records;
* Fetch the latest version of the full dataset;

If so - we want your help. See [this post](https://groups.google.com/a/open-contracting.org/forum/#!topic/standard-discuss/HtSYpbH5QGY).
