The scope of this framework will be the analysis of, and reporting on, samples collected in accordance with this programme for a selection of the required determinants. The scope will include the provision of sample bottles for the selected determinants and collection and transportation of completed samples from Wessex Water's laboratory at Saltford (near Bath) to the successful economic operator's laboratory for analysis. The sampling itself will be undertaken by Wessex Water Services Ltd and is not in the scope of this framework. Further details are provided in the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ).
