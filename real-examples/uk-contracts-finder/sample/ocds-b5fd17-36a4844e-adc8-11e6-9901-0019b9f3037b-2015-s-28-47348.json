        "description": "'Transport for London (TfL) is acting as the lead in putting in place a Framework Agreement for Property Partnerships. The Contracting Authority as defined in VI.3 is seeking to establish a multi-supplier Framework Agreement for up to 10 years. The Framework Agreement will enable the award of call-off contracts for the development of sites identified by the Contracting Authority for delivery through the formation of a Joint Venture vehicle (JV). In forming any such JV, a Supplier will be required to provide or procure the provision of funding for the development, provide development management services and, potentially, provide or procure the provision of related ancillary works and services to the Contracting Authority. The Contracting Authority has a need to develop a selection of sites that it owns in the Capital to maximise the economic value of those sites back to the Contracting Authority, in order to increase revenue. The sites vary in size and readiness for development and include, but are not limited to, buildings that offer the potential for residential conversion, mixed use or residential developments, major regeneration schemes in town centres, brownfield developments in inner and outer London and land attached to, adjacent to or over stations, depots, railways, highways, bus or other operational property and transport infrastructure. The Framework Agreement will provide the Contracting Authority with the ability to partner with Suppliers for the purposes of developing sites identified by the Contracting Authority for delivery in joint venture and obtain the benefit of the Suppliers' services and provision by Suppliers of ancillary works and services (being those which are ancillary to the relevant development). The scope of the Contracting Authority's requirements through the Framework Agreement is expected to cover all or any part of a property development cycle and will include, but not be limited to, development management services including planning services, site surveying, scheme design and specification, construction design and management, community and stakeholder management, site valuation, development appraisals, marketing, programme management and construction implementation strategy. A Supplier awarded a call-off contract may be required to supply the services either directly to the relevant Contracting Authority or to the relevant site JV. The JV may also be required to supply works or services directly to the relevant Contracting Authority In addition to providing these services, Suppliers may also be required to provide further services related to the development of proposals to develop sites including, but not limited to, the development of detailed business plans (including development appraisals) and the development of and implementation of funding strategies as part of any call-off contract. Suppliers will also be required to demonstrate that they are able to provide or procure the provision of funds to support sit",
