This project will replace the existing telephony system with a comprehensive contact centre service, including the capacity for Westward to provide a 24/7 service. Your solution will need to have the capacity to integrate with all back office software primarily Capita Open Housing but also including Microsoft office products (this is not an exhaustive list of software used by Westward). Your solution must support flexible staff working including mobile working, multi location, hot-desking and options on home-working. Your proposed system will help minimise call fall-outs, providing a flexibility to meet the changing demands of customers to offer improved customer experience.'",
