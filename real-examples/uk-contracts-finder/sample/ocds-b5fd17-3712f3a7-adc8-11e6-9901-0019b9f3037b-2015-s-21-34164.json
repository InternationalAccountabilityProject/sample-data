        "description": "'Established in 2008 Academies Enterprise Trust (AET) is the largest multi-sponsor of academies in the UK and comprises an estate of some 74 academies throughout the UK. Each academy needs to provide a cleaning service but each academy differs in size complexity and service management; some contract out their services whilst others manage the services In-House. RM&C has managed the tender process for several of the Academies within the trust and we have now been asked to standardise the tender procedures by initially forming a Regional and National Framework of companies to be considered in future tenders. After formation of the Framework each Academy wishing to tender their cleaning service will be able to select companies within their particular Region and follow a Mini Competition' process. This process will be either managed directly by the Academy using an agreed RM&C specification or directly by RM&C.
